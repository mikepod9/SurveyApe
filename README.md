# SurveyApe
A survey and user feedback collection web app.<br />
This web app was developed using JavaScript on NodeJS, utilizing Express and MongoDB for the backend and React/Redux for the frontend.<br />
Based on the Udemy course https://www.udemy.com/node-with-react-fullstack-web-development/

# Production Version
The app is hosted on Heroku at: https://quiet-brook-52305.herokuapp.com/<br />
Since the app was created for my personal educational purposes, the payment API used in this app is in a permanent test mode.<br />
As such, to properly interact with the app please use a fake credit card such as the ones presented here:<br />
